# v1.0 Roadmap Archive: DVC Dashboard

**Shipped:** 2026-02-10
**Duration:** 2 days (Feb 9-10, 2026)
**Stats:** 3 phases, 9 plans, 34 commits, 93 files, 18,638 LOC, 141 tests

## Overview

Build a personal DVC points management dashboard in three phases: first establish the data foundation (contracts, point balances, point charts), then layer on the calculation engine and reservation tracking, and finally deliver the unified dashboard and trip explorer views. Scraping is deferred to v2 -- the entire v1 works with manual data entry, which is the correct risk posture given Disney site fragility.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Contract & Point Management** -- Full CRUD for DVC contracts and point balances with resale eligibility engine (14 original resorts vs 3 restricted)
2. **Versioned Point Chart System** -- JSON-based point charts with heat-map table, season calendar, and stay cost calculator (Polynesian + Riviera 2026)
3. **Point Availability Engine** -- Pure-function calculator accounting for banking, borrowing, expiration, and reservation deductions across all contracts
4. **Reservation Tracking** -- Full reservation lifecycle with eligibility validation and automatic point deductions from availability
5. **Unified Dashboard** -- At-a-glance view with summary cards (4 stats), urgent alerts (60-day banking / 90-day expiration), and upcoming reservations
6. **Trip Explorer** -- "What can I afford?" search composing availability, eligibility, and cost calculations into sorted affordable options

## Phases

### Phase 1: Data Foundation
**Goal**: User can manage their DVC contracts, enter point balances, and the system has point chart data to power all downstream calculations
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04, DATA-05, PNTS-01, PNTS-02, PNTS-03
**Completed:** 2026-02-09

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffolding + database foundation (backend/frontend setup, models, migrations, resort data)
- [x] 01-02: Contract & point balance management (CRUD API + UI, eligibility logic, use year timeline)
- [x] 01-03: Point chart data system (JSON schema, data loading, versioned storage, cost lookup API + UI)

### Phase 2: Calculations & Reservations
**Goal**: User can pick any future date and see exactly what points are available across all contracts, manage reservations, and look up trip costs -- with reservations properly deducted from all calculations
**Requirements**: PNTS-04, PNTS-05, PNTS-06, TRIP-01, TRIP-03, TRIP-04, TRIP-05
**Completed:** 2026-02-09

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Reservation model + point availability engine
- [x] 02-02: Reservation & availability API
- [x] 02-03: Reservation & availability UI

### Phase 3: Dashboard & Trip Explorer
**Goal**: User has a unified home page showing their complete DVC picture at a glance and can query "what can I afford?" to discover bookable options
**Requirements**: TRIP-02, DASH-01, DASH-02
**Completed:** 2026-02-10

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Trip Explorer backend (engine function + API endpoint)
- [x] 03-02: Dashboard page (summary cards, urgent alerts, upcoming reservations)
- [x] 03-03: Trip Explorer UI + navigation updates

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI 0.128, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async), Alembic 1.18, aiosqlite, Python 3.12
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite 7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, React Router 7
- **Storage**: SQLite (single-user, zero-config)
- **Data**: JSON point charts (versioned by year), 17 DVC resorts reference data
