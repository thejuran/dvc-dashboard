# v1.0 Requirements Archive: DVC Dashboard

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Shipped:** 2026-02-10
**Core Value:** For any future date, clearly show available points across all contracts and what resorts/rooms those points can actually book -- accounting for banking, borrowing, existing reservations, and resale restrictions.

## v1 Requirements -- All Complete

### Data & Contracts

- [x] **DATA-01**: User can add a DVC contract with home resort, use year month, annual point allocation, and resale/direct purchase type
- [x] **DATA-02**: User can edit or remove an existing contract
- [x] **DATA-03**: User can manually enter current point balances per contract (current year, banked, borrowed)
- [x] **DATA-04**: System stores DVC point charts (point costs per resort, room type, view category, season, and day-of-week)
- [x] **DATA-05**: Point charts are versioned by year so current and future year charts can coexist

### Point Tracking

- [x] **PNTS-01**: User can view point balance summary per contract showing current year, banked, and borrowed points
- [x] **PNTS-02**: User can view use year timeline per contract showing banking deadline, use year start/end, and point expiration dates
- [x] **PNTS-03**: System correctly identifies which resorts each contract can book at based on resale/direct status
- [x] **PNTS-04**: User can pick a future date and see total available points across all contracts for that date
- [x] **PNTS-05**: Point timeline calculator shows per-contract breakdown (which contract's points from which use year contribute to the total)
- [x] **PNTS-06**: Point timeline calculator accounts for banking deadlines, expiration, and existing reservation commitments

### Trip Planning

- [x] **TRIP-01**: User can look up point cost for a specific resort, room type, and date range
- [x] **TRIP-02**: User can query "what can I afford?" -- given available points for a date range, see all bookable resort/room options filtered by resale eligibility
- [x] **TRIP-03**: User can view a list of existing reservations with resort, room type, dates, and point cost
- [x] **TRIP-04**: User can manually add, edit, or remove reservations
- [x] **TRIP-05**: Reservation point costs are deducted from available point balances in all calculations

### Dashboard

- [x] **DASH-01**: User sees a dashboard home page with at-a-glance view of all contracts, point balances, and upcoming reservations
- [x] **DASH-02**: Dashboard highlights urgent items (points expiring soon, upcoming banking deadlines)

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

These were identified during v1 but intentionally deferred:

### Scraping & Automation
- **SCRP-01**: System can authenticate with DVC member website and import contract/point data automatically
- **SCRP-02**: System can import existing reservations from DVC member website
- **SCRP-03**: User can trigger a manual sync and see "last synced" timestamp

### Advanced Planning
- **ADVN-01**: User can preview the impact of a potential booking on their point situation before committing
- **ADVN-02**: User can model what-if banking/borrowing scenarios and see projected point availability
- **ADVN-03**: System shows key date reminders (banking deadlines, 11-month/7-month booking windows)
- **ADVN-04**: User can view a seasonal cost heatmap showing point costs across an entire year for a given resort/room

## Out of Scope (Permanent)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Multi-user / sharing | Personal tool, single user only |
| Real-time availability checking | Fragile scraping, legally gray |
| Automated booking | Violates Disney ToS |
| Point rental marketplace | Entire separate business |
| Dining / park reservation planning | Scope creep |
| Mobile native app | Web-first via browser |
| Annual dues tracking | Doesn't improve point planning |
| Community features | Not a social platform |
